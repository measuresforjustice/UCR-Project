We investigate the effects of broad-based work incentives on female crime
by exploiting the welfare reform legislation of the 1990s, which
dramatically increased employment among women at risk for relying on cash
assistance. We find that welfare reform decreased female property crime
arrests by 4-5%, but did not affect other types of crimes. The effects
appear to be stronger in states with lower welfare benefits and higher
earnings disregards, and in states with larger caseload declines. The
findings point to broad-based work incentives--and, by inference,
employment--as a key determinant of female property crime.

Crime of Violence? An Analysis of National Data 1998-2007." Final Technical
Report. NCJ 248651, Jan 2015. 2010-IJ-CX-0009
Abstract: https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=270754
Full text PDF: https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/248651.pdf
The analysis of national data on burglary obtained from Uniform Crime
Reports, National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVSs), and the National
Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) for 1998-2007 indicates that the
majority of burglaries did not involve physical violence and there was weak
evidence of even the possibility of violence. The incidence of actual
violence or threats of violence during burglaries ranged from a low of 9
percent in rural areas based on NIBRS data, to a high of 7.6 percent in
urban areas based on NCVSs. At most, 2.7 percent involved actual violent
acts. A comprehensive content analysis of the provisions of State burglary
and habitual offender statutes, however, found that burglary is often
treated as a violent crime instead of prosecuting and punishing it as a
property crime, while separately charging and punishing convicted offenders
for any violent acts that occasionally co-occur with burglary. The
discussion of policy implications of these findings suggests reform of
current statutes that do not reflect the documented characteristics of
burglary offenses. It suggests that at a minimum, only burglary of an
occupied building be regarded as a serious crime; preferably, the revised
law should require that an actual act of violence or threatened violence
occur before burglary can be prosecuted as a violent crime. 3 figures, 13

The FBI's UCR program, which began in 1929, collects information on the
following crimes reported to law enforcement authorities: homicide,
forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor
vehicle theft, and arson. Arrests are reported for 21 additional crime
categories. The UCR data are compiled from monthly law enforcement reports
or individual crime incident records transmitted directly to the FBI or to
centralized State agencies that then report to the FBI. The Bureau of
Justice Statistics NCVS program, which began in 1973, provides a detailed
picture of crime incidents, victims, and trends. U.S. Census Bureau
personnel interview all household members at least 12 years old in a
nationally representative sample of approximately 49,000 households. The
NCVS collects information on crimes suffered by individuals and households,
whether or not those crimes were reported to law enforcement. It estimates
the proportion of each crime type reported to law enforcement and
summarizes the reasons that victims give for reporting or not reporting
their victimization. As much as their different collection methods permit,
the UCR and the NCVS measure the same subset of serious crimes, defined the
same. This paper also reviews the differences in the two measures of crime
and how the two together provide a greater understanding of crime in the
United States than either does alone.

This report was prepared using actual data supplied by law enforcement
agencies to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program under its [then] new
National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Its purpose is to
demonstrate a potential utility of the NIBRS data,
and its content should not be viewed as a reliable indicator of the family
violence experience. The [then] current volume of data in the NIBRS is too
small to produce any reliable national statements on this topic. This
report, however, is an example of the national analysis that will be
possible as the database grows.

Since its inception, the UCR, has tracked data on seven crimes: murder,
robbery, rape, aggravated assault, burglary, theft, and vehicle theft. In
1979, the UCR began reporting on arson. Currently, nearly 17,000 law
enforcement agencies report UCR data to the FBI. UCR data, however, have
several limitations that impair their use in analyzing local crime; for
example, the UCR does not provide specific information on each incident,
such as location, characteristics of the victim and offender, and injuries
they received. In addition, if multiple crimes occur at the same scene,
only the most serious is recorded. Also, the UCR does not allow police to
report whether an arrest was made at the crime scene. Largely because of
these limitations of the UCR system, the FBI began to revise the system in
the 1980s. The result was the NIBRS, which enhances UCR data by enabling
descriptions of details about 46 types of criminal activity. Officers can
record information about each incident, including details on victim and
offender characteristics, features of each crime that occurred at the
scene, and whether an arrest was made. Due to the addition of such data for
official crime reporting, a police executive or a mayorâ€™s policy adviser
can look at NIBRS data alone or combine them with other citywide data,
analyze them, and obtain a more comprehensive view of criminal activity in
the community. Researchers have successfully used NIBRS data to assess dual
arrest data and examine drug distribution. As of 2004, NIBRS data have been
supplied to the FBI by 5,271 law enforcement agencies that represent
approximately 20 percent of the total U.S. population. 1 table and 3 notes

Four deliverable items were provided to the National Institute of Justice
(NIJ) as the work product of this grant: (1) cleaned UCR data for the 50
States and the District of Columbia; (2) a UCR charting utility to allow
users to plot monthly crime data; (3) a set of instructions to allow the
addition of subsequent years of data; and (4) an analysis of the nature and
extent of â€œmissingnessâ€ in the UCR data. The UCR is a collection of crime
data from law enforcement agencies around the country that voluntarily
report their crime data. Although the UCR has undergone major revisions
during its lifetime, problems with the data persist, including missing data
and misreporting problems. The researchers describe obtaining and
organizing the UCR data, which involved combining the data from annual
files into longitudinal files running from January 1960 to December 2002.
Types of data extracted are described and include monthly crime counts for
the seven index crimes, population counts, county indicators, and
population groups. The data cleaning process was largely automatic and was
accomplished through the use of a set of macros that enabled depictions of
a time series for each crime category, which highlighted needed changes.
Each of the macros is described, followed by a description of the â€œfine
tuningâ€ of the data, which included a consideration of the multiple
agencies submitting UCR data. Explanations about the clean UCR dataset,
which is housed in Excel workbooks, and procedures for incorporating
additional yearâ€™s data are offered. Three tasks are identified that will
make future revisions of the UCR data more effective: (1) develop
imputation methods to account for missing data; (2) combine individual
Originating Agency Identifiers to permit the calculation of countrywide
crime data; and (3) identify anomalies in the crime subcategories. Table,

Departments and Crime Status in Virginia Communities: An Assessment from
the Citizen Perspective." 2018. DOI: 10.13021/G86H45
This report presents the first extensive assessment of crime status and
police performance for communities in Virginia. Twenty-four counties and 29
cities were studied for the period 2015 and 2016. Performance was rated
from a citizen, rather than a professional law enforcement perspective.
Special attention was given to African American communities. The assessment
utilized publicly accessible data sources including demographic data from
the U.S. Census Bureau, police department web sites, FBI UCR crime
statistics, media reports, and other data.
We conclude that community history and characteristics, along with police
performance, are major influences on local crime rates. This is a
preliminary report, pending transfer of data to relational database format,
which is expected to facilitate more extensive data comparisons.

The authors of this report compared patterns of violent victimization in
the Bakken oil-producing region to those in surrounding counties outside of
the Bakken region. This report focuses on trends in violent crime from 2006
to 2012, a period during which regions of Montana and North Dakota that
contain parts of the Bakken shale formation experienced relatively rapid
growth in oil and gas production, an influx of new residents to work in oil
sectorâ€“related jobs, and according to reports from the area, a
corresponding increase in calls for service to local law enforcement. The
information in this report comes from Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)-
sponsored analysis of data from the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s
(FBIâ€™s) National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). From 2006 to
2012, the rate of violent victimization known to law enforcement in the
Bakken oil-producing region of Montana and North Dakota increased,
particularly the rate of aggravated assault, which increased 70%. There was
no similar increase in rates of violent crime in the counties surrounding
the Bakken oil region. Rates of male and female violent victimization in
the Bakken region increased during this period, with the increase being
higher for males (up 31%) than females (up 18%).

In early 2014, the Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and
Response Office asked the RAND National Defense Research Institute to
conduct an independent assessment of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and
gender discrimination in the military â€” an assessment last conducted in
2012 by the department itself with its Workplace and Gender Relations
Survey of Active Duty Personnel. This volume documents the methodology used
in the resulting RAND Military Workplace Study, which invited close to
560,000 service members to participate in a survey fielded in August and
September of 2014. It describes the survey methods, how the new
questionnaire was designed, and how sampling, recruitment, and analytic
weighting were pursued. It also includes the entire survey instrument.

BJS released a solicitation in 2013 for a survey of the tribal activities
and caseloads of all State and local law enforcement agencies and all local
prosecutorsâ€™ offices that provided services on tribal lands. BJS also
designed a national survey of tribal courts; and it expanded the survey of
jails in Indian country in order to explore other offense types, including
burglary, larceny-theft, and public intoxication. In addition, BJS is
preparing a report that documents the processing of American Indian or
Alaska Native Juvenile and adult cases in the Federal justice system. The
BJS Web site continues to be the central source of Department of Justice
tribal statistics and funding opportunities for improved data reporting in
national record systems. The number of tribal law enforcement agencies that
are reporting crime data in the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program
increased from 143 in 2010 to 168 in 2011. Tribes received $404,317 through
the Bureau of Justice Assistanceâ€™s 2013 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice
Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. BJS also announced multiple funding
opportunities in 2013 for improving tribal criminal history records and the
reporting of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm
under State or Federal law. A figure shows the total JAG allocations to
American Indian tribes for 2008-2013. Another figure shows the total tribal
law enforcement agencies reporting identifiable violent and property crimes
for 2008-2011, and a table presents data on total violent and property
crimes reported by these agencies for each of these years. Previously
released reports on tribal crime data collection activities are listed.

The study was conducted over a 3-year period and addressed 40 distinct
cases of serious assaults on law enforcement officers. The cases involved
52 victim officers and 42 offenders. Routine, repetitive tasks emerged as a
continuing threat to officer safety. Traffic stops, searches, and use of
handcuffs are examples of tasks that should be second nature to officers
but presented problems to the victims in the cases studied. Officers cited
training as critical to the actions they took to protect themselves. Post-
assault trauma and recovery proved to be areas that perhaps have not
received appropriate attention from the law enforcement community. Many of
the victim officers in the study displayed an uncommon "will to survive,"
an attitude many officers attributed to their survival training. This
article reports extensive information on the victims, offenders, and
incidents studied, and identifies specific areas where law enforcement
training and procedures may be improved. Figures, tables, appendixes,

In 1980, half of all arrests involved persons ages 15 to 24; by 2017, the
percentage of arrests for this age group decreased to 29 percent. Since
2008, arrest rates have declined 60 percent for ages 15-17, 50 percent for
ages 18-20, and 31 percent for ages 21-24. In 2017, juveniles ages 15-17
accounted for 19 percent of arrests of persons ages 15-24; however, the
proportion varied by offense. Proportions are shown for robbery, aggravated
assault, simple assault, burglary, larceny-theft, and disorderly conduct.
The proportion of person and property arrests was greater for older
juveniles than young adults in 2017. The proportion of arrests for violent
crimes involving youth ages 15-17 has declined since 1980. 5 figures

The information reported in this bulletin analyzes the extent and nature of
juvenile crime that comes to the attention of the justice system. Results
show that in 2007, law enforcement agencies in the United States made an
estimated 2.18 million arrests of persons under age 18. Overall, there were
2 percent fewer juvenile arrests in 2007 than in 2006, and juvenile violent
crime arrests declined 3 percent, reversing a recent upward trend. Juvenile
arrest rates, particularly Violent Crime Index rates, had increased in 2005
and again in 2006 amid fears that the Nation was on the brink of another
juvenile crime wave. Latest data showed increases in some offense
categories but declines in most, with most changes being less than 10
percent in either direction. Data for these findings were collected from
local law enforcement agencies across the country who reported to the
FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. Based on these data, the FBI
prepares the statistical compilation which summarizes crime known to police
and arrests made during the reporting calendar year.

Highlights of findings include: 1) law enforcement agencies made an
estimated 2.11 million arrests of persons younger than age 18 in 2008; 2)
there were 3 percent fewer juvenile arrests in 2008 than in 2007 and
juvenile violent crime arrests fell 2 percent; 3) about 1 in 10 (n = 1,740)
murder victims was a juvenile; 4) 1 in 8 violent crimes was attributed to
juveniles; 5) juvenile property crime arrests increased for the second
consecutive year; 6) 22 percent of arrests involving youth who were
eligible for processing in the juvenile justice system were handled within
law enforcement agencies, and the youth were released, 66 percent were
referred to juvenile court, and 10 percent were referred directly to
criminal court; 7) females accounted for 30 percent of juvenile arrests;
and 8) for 2008, the racial composition of the United States juvenile
population ages 10-17 was 78 percent White, 16 percent African-American, 5
percent Asian/Pacific Islanders, and 1 percent American Indian. This
bulletin presents data reported by local law enforcement agencies across
the United States to the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Report (UCR) Program on
juvenile arrests for 2008. Tables, figures, and notes

The U.S. law enforcement agencies made 1.6 million arrests of individuals
under age 18 in 2010, a 21-percent decline from 2001 and 9-percent decline
since 2009. The number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes showed a
12-percent reduction from 2009, continuing a 4-year decline. This was the
lowest number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes in at least 30
years. Compared with the number of adults arrested in 2010, juveniles
composed a relatively small proportion of all arrests: approximately 1 in
10 for murder; approximately 1 in 4 for robbery, burglary, and disorderly
conduct; and approximately 1 in 5 arrests for larceny-theft and motor
vehicle theft. As in past years, youth of minority races/ethnicities were
arrested at a disproportionate rate compared to their proportion of the
general population. Users of these statistics are reminded that these
arrest statistics report the number of arrests made by law enforcement
agencies in a given year, not the number of individuals (It is possible
that the same individuals were arrested more than once). Neither should the
arrest statistics be equated with the number of crimes committed by
juveniles. The arrest counts are shown by the ages of arrestees and offense
categories contained in the arrest charges. The proportion of the U.S.
population covered by the agencies reporting 2010 UCR data represented
jurisdictions covering approximately 81 percent of the United States. 3

Contrary to the popular perception that juvenile crime is increasing, the
data reported in this bulletin indicate that juvenile arrests for violent
offenses decreased 10 percent between 2008 and 2009; juvenile arrests for
all types of offenses declined 9 percent during the same period; still,
juvenile crime and violence continue to impact communities across the
country. Between 2000 and 2009, juvenile arrests for robbery increased 15
percent, and juvenile arrests for murder remained unchanged. In 2009, there
were 578,500 arrests of females younger than age 18. Between 2000 and 2009,
arrests of female juveniles decreased less than arrests of male juveniles
in several offense categories. In 2009, 12 percent of arrests involved
White juveniles and 14 percent involved Black juveniles. Between 1980 and
the peak in 1991, the arrests rate for juveniles charged with forcible rape
increased 50 percent. After 1991, the arrest rate for juveniles charged
with forcible rape gradually declined, reaching a level in 2009 that was 58
percent below the 1991 peak; juveniles arrested for forcible rape in 2009
constituted the fewest such arrests in at least three decades. Trends in
juvenile arrest rates through 2009 are also reported for robbery,
aggravated assault, property crimes as a whole, burglary, larceny-theft,
motor vehicle theft, arson, simple assault, weapons violations, and drug
offenses. Extensive tables and figures

Summarizes and analyzes national and state juvenile arrest data presented
in the FBI report Crime in the United States 2004. As the Bulletin reports,
the juvenile violent crime arrest rate in 2004 reached its lowest level
since 1980. The rate, which grew substantially during the late 1980s and
peaked in 1994, has decreased for 10 consecutive years. In 2004, it was
half its 1994 peak level. The juvenile arrest rate for each of the offenses
tracked in the FBI's Violent Crime Index (murder, forcible rape, robbery,
and aggravated assault) has been declining steadily since the mid-1990s;
for murder, the rate fell 77% from its 1993 peak through 2004.

NCS data show that from 1973-77 both the number and rate of personal
victimizations committed by juveniles decreased, while victimization
committed by adults increased. Personal victimizations committed by
juveniles were less serious in terms of weapon use, injury rate, and
financial loss than similar crimes by adults. UCR data find that adult
arrests for serious crime increased more than juvenile arrests in the
1970's. Juvenile courts are more likely than adult courts to convict
offenders; some 55 percent of serious juvenile cases result in some form of
supervision or incarceration, including informal supervision of cases
handled without petition. Of cases resulting in a criminal conviction or
delinquency adjudication, however, the criminal court is more likely to
sentence an adult felon to incarceration while the juvenile court is more
likely to impose probation. Almost every State provides some avenue to
criminal court for serious offenders over 15 years old. The more serious
their present offenses are and the more prior delinquency referrals
juveniles have, the more likely it is they will be waived to criminal
court, or, if adjudicated delinquent, institutionalized. Data tables and
six references are supplied.

The original UCR system provides summaries for a limited number of
characteristics and cannot identify crime patterns rapidly. Recognizing the
limited usefulness of this system, the FBI began redesigning the UCR
program in 1982. The basic elements of the new program have now been
established, and the revised program will be implemented over the next 5 to
10 years. The most important feature of the new system is that it is
incident-based. Participating police departments will report some
information on each incident, rather than just the total number of
incidents in each crime category. The new system gathers additional
information about victims, including the victim-offender relationship, the
seriousness and nature of physical injuries, victims' age, race, sex, and
other characteristics. The system also covers all reported offenses, not
just the current Part 1 offenses. In addition, information on suspects will
be collected, allowing a link between criminal history records and crime
records. The computerization of recordkeeping by local police departments
will also improve accuracy, keep files available, reduce the space needed,
and improve data security and access. It will enable managers to go beyond
clearance rates to establish comprehensive case tracking systems. The
public will also become better informed. The new UCR will be more expensive
than the current system, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. Figures

records. The computerization of recordkeeping by local police departments
will also improve accuracy, keep files available, reduce the space needed,
and improve data security and access. It will enable managers to go beyond
clearance rates to establish comprehensive case tracking systems. The
public will also become better informed. The new UCR will be more expensive
than the current system, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. Figures

The original UCR system provides summaries for a limited number of
characteristics and cannot identify crime patterns rapidly. Recognizing the
limited usefulness of this system, the FBI began redesigning the UCR
program in 1982. The basic elements of the new program have now been
established, and the revised program will be implemented over the next 5 to
10 years. The most important feature of the new system is that it is
incident-based. Participating police departments will report some
information on each incident, rather than just the total number of
incidents in each crime category. The new system gathers additional
information about victims, including the victim-offender relationship, the
seriousness and nature of physical injuries, victims' age, race, sex, and
other characteristics. The system also covers all reported offenses, not
just the current Part 1 offenses. In addition, information on suspects will
be collected, allowing a link between criminal history records and crime
records. The computerization of recordkeeping by local police departments
will also improve accuracy, keep files available, reduce the space needed,
and improve data security and access. It will enable managers to go beyond
clearance rates to establish comprehensive case tracking systems. The
public will also become better informed. The new UCR will be more expensive
than the current system, but the benefits far outweigh the costs. Figures

A discussion of data sources and data limits for the study covers the
Juvenile Detention and Correctional Facility Census, a survey of Youths in
Custody, the National Jail Census, current population reports, Uniform
Crime Reports, and juvenile court statistics. Data address juvenile
arrests, admissions to and 1-day counts in juvenile facilities, resident
offenses, resident race/ethnicity, resident drug use and facility drug
programming, and resident educational status and facility educational
programming. Statistics are also provided on facility types, capacity, and
staff; facility crowding; facility average length of stay; facility
expenditures; and youths in jails. Although the rate of juvenile arrests
for Part I violent crimes remained stable over the decade and the rates of
Part I property crimes declined significantly, the rates of admissions to
both detention centers and training schools are beginning to increase,
notably for black and Hispanic youth. Appended supplementary information
and data, 51 tables, 13 figures.

The study was conducted over a 3-year period; the 51 incidents resulted in
the death of 54 police officers and involved 50 offenders. Results
demonstrated that, while no single offender profile could be established,
most killers of police officers had been diagnosed as having some type of
personality disorder. Behavioral descriptors of victims were frequently
similar in that they were good-natured and more conservative than their
fellow officers in the use of physical force. The incidents themselves
revealed that killings were often facilitated by some type of procedural
miscue (e.g., improper approach to a vehicle). Type of assignment,
circumstances at the scene of an encounter, weapons involved, and the
environment in which events occurred all played a role in the preponderance
of police officer deaths in the South. The report presents extensive
information on the victims, offenders, and incidents studied. It identifies
personality types of offenders, provides guidance on how individuals of a
given personality type interact with authority figures, and offers
approaches to interrogation. The report also points out specific areas
where law enforcement training and procedures may be improved. Appendixes
contain the study methodology and a description of personality types. 65

This report supported by the U.S. Department of Justice, National Institute
of Justice (NIJ) presents a summary and analysis of literature on alcohol-
and drug-related crime in American Indian/Alaskan Native (AI/AN)
communities. The report begins with an analysis of the epidemiology of
AI/AN substance abuse providing a better understanding of the nature of
alcohol and other drug use that co-occurs with AI/AN crime. Highlights of
key points that emerged include: (1) national surveys indicate AI/ANs are
more likely than the general public to report being symptomatic of alcohol
and drug use disorders as defined in the American Psychiatric Associationâ€™s
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and (2) alcohol and
drug use among AI/AN youth has been the subject of a considerable amount of
research, most of which indicates a higher lifetime prevalence relative to
the general population. After examining existing research on substance
abuse and crime in AI/AN communities, higher levels of alcohol involvement
in AI/AN crime was found and AI/ANs who use alcohol were more likely to be
a crime victim or perpetrator. The report also examined research on policy
responses to the problem of drug- and alcohol-involved crime among AI/ANs.
With the exception of one policy, local alcohol prohibition, very little is
known about the effects of criminal justice policy and specific initiatives
aimed at reducing alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. The
report presents and discusses a number of research approaches that have the
potential to improve the understanding of legal and criminal justice
responses to alcohol and drug related crime in AI/AN communities. Tables

It has been long recognized that cash plays a critical role in fueling
street crime due to its liquidity and transactional anonymity. In poor
neighborhoods where street offenses are concentrated, a significant source
of circulating cash stems from public assistance or welfare payments. In
the 1990s, the Federal government mandated individual states to convert the
delivery of their welfare benefits from paper checks to an Electronic
Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, whereby recipients received and expended
their funds through debit cards. In this paper, we examine whether the
reduction in the circulation of cash on the streets associated with EBT
implementation had an effect on crime. To address this question, we exploit
the variation in the timing of the EBT implementation across Missouri
counties. Our results indicate that the EBT program had a negative and
significant effect on the overall crime rate as well as burglary, assault,
and larceny. According to our point estimates, the overall crime rate
decreased by 9.8 percent in response to the EBT program. We also find a
negative effect on arrests, especially those associated with non-drug
offenses. EBT implementation had no effect on rape, a crime that is
unlikely to be motivated by the acquisition of cash. Interestingly, the
significant drop in crime in the United States over several decades has
coincided with a period of steady decline in the proportion of financial
transactions involving cash. In that sense, our findings serve as a fresh
contribution to the important debate surrounding the factors underpinning
the great American crime decline.
